# sof

**sof** stands for Stephane Own Font, very simply. This acronym is also an hebrew word: ["סוף"](https://translate.google.fr/?sl=iw&tl=en&text=%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A3&op=translate "Google Translate for 'סוף', and its pronunciation"), which means "end", I'll explain later why I wanted to make this word related to my font.
